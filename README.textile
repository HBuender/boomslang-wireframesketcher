*** Boomslang specifics ***

Due to a Tycho bug (id 389698), the p2 repository for this project needs to be built separately. 

Commands for a full build:
  > mvn install
  > cd com.wireframesketcher.model.repository.remote
  > mvn install

After this, the boomslang build is able to use this patched WireframeSketcher model's P2 repository.
